# 3Signet-Image-classification-task

## Features  
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit, making it easy to use for all users.  
- **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The model predicts one of 100 fine-grained classes from the CIFAR-100 dataset.  
- **Pre-trained Neural Network**: Pre-trained model is the Resnet 50 and TensorFlow/Keras model optimized for accurate classification. Model validation accuracy was about 41 to 43% which gives room for improvement. The model was chosen after experimenting with different model architectures. 
- **Real-time Predictions**: Upload an image, and get instant classification results.  (https://3signet-image-classification-task-fujey3wwxhk8rvkqqq264m.streamlit.app/)
